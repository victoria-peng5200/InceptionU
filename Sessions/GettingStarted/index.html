    <h1>Syntax and Communication</h1>
    <h2>Where are we?</h2>
    <p>We have been working with systems and starting to understand the layers of a full stack application. This is sort
        of an "outside-in" or "top-down" approach to understanding how applications are built.
    </p>
    <p>Today we flip the picture upside down and look at the individual files that make up the parts of a full stack
        system, starting with the concept of syntax. We will introduce our first syntax, namely HTML.</p>
    <h2>When we write something down...</h2>
    <p>...we capture a bit of speech as symbols on a page. The set of rules we use when we do that is called the
        language "syntax".</p>
    <p>Let's get an example from the class. The situation is your parents are coming to visit soon and the children are
        making a mess in the living room that you want cleaned up. What would you say to command them to clean it up!
    </p>
    <p>(put up two or three examples from the class)</p>
    <h3>Syntax versus semantics</h3>
    <p>Compare the examples.  Notice the words they used are different, but despite this the meaning is the same.  What rules can we find that are consistent between the examples when examining the symbol sequences letter by letter?</p>
    <p>The consistent rules are the "syntax."  If we mess with the syntax, it can make the message invalid, or even dramatically change the meaning of the sentence.  Syntax is meant to be regular.  Lets try changing some things to see what happens.</p>
    <p>The choices we make (like which word to use) combine with the syntax form the meaning of the sentence.  This is the "semantics" of the sentence.  Notice all the examples use the same basic syntax but different word choice and order. It is the word choice that leads to similar semantics between the messages.</p>
    <h3>Follow on</h3>
    <p>Get an example in Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese for the same.  Uncover new syntax rules by discovering that didn't surface in our earlier examples.</p>
